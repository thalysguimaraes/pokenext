# PokéNext

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project for studying purposes. The initial idea is to build a functional PokéDex using [PokéApi](https://pokeapi.co/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for the front-end components. As a designer is my first experience with many of these things, so I'll use the README to keep track of my evolution.

### v0.1
Updated at 21/12

#### Changelog
- Header with an initial logo concept and a functional toggle-button to switch between light, dark and system themes;
- Hard-coded list of the first 8 Pokemóns showing ID, photo, name, type and a (non-functional) details button;
- Simple footer;


#### What's next
- Pull some data from the API and ditch the hard-coded Pokemóns;
